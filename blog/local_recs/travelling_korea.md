### Trust me, you will not regret 

People travel a lot and they use different sources of information to find the best restaurants, hotels, or cafes. For me, my go-to approach is to just directly ask locals. It's arguably the most fail-proof option compared to other online sources.

#### So you want to visit Korea?
I'd say consider going to places other than Seoul. Seoul is beautiful of course, but I think the cities outside of Seoul is truly more charming at the end. Let me share some of my personal recommendations: (though I've lived primarily at the southern part of Korea)

#### Nice Cities
- Jinhae
- Andong + Cheongsong + Yeongdeok
- Suncheon
- Gangneung
- Gyeongju  
- Some parts of Jeju Island

#### Not As Nice Cities
- Busan
- Seoul
- Changwon

I'd like to explain more about why and share some good places you should visit.

### Jinhae
Please, check out Jinhae! It's truly a beautiful place that not many foreign tourists know. A quaint harbor city that is surrounded by a magnificent mountain (fun fact: even the royals visited in 1800s to celebrate the birth of the prince), it's a historic city known for its cherry blossom trees. For me, I love this city because it's beautiful and humble. It's like a seeing a street musician who sings spectacularly. 

In Jinhae, there are so many places to visit: sea, local markets full of fish, 600m mountains, cypress trees forest, lake, park, etc. You can easily find different kinds of unique birds and fish in the city, not to mention  stray cats and their kittens roaming the city. Locals like growing fresh fruits and vegetables in their small gardens everywhere even in some parts of train rails. These people know how to grow food. Because of the military base, there used to be height restrictions on buildings which made the city very beautiful and unique compared to apartment jungles in different cities. I'm just so unhappy that they removed that restriction recently. It's still a beautiful city that is not overpriced and has friendly people.

#### 1. Jujae Coffee
Hands down the best coffee shop in Jinhae or the whole country.

#### 2. Coffee Sunny
Also nice coffee place that is big and well-designed. Can also look at the ocean.

#### 3. Haneulchae
My favorite Bossam place (boiled pork)

#### 4. Yoon Baekjeong
The best pork belly place

#### 5. Jang cheon jip
Also nice pork belly place

#### 6. Dol dam gil
Really nice scallion pancakes and other food. Old and famous. You can even tell the taxi driver to go to Dol Dam Gil and they'll know. No need to say their address.

#### 7. Imsil Cheese Pizza
Her pizza is the best around there. She sometimes works until 4AM to meet the demand. Really sweet to talk to her.

#### 8. Jinhae Soohyeop Fish market
Good place to buy Hwe (It's like sashimi). Good quality fish but you should probably need to speak in Korean and have a place to eat. It's just for take out.

#### 9. Cypress tree forest + Sammil Temple
Really beautiful forest full of cypress trees and cherry blossom trees. Sammil Temple is a good destination to visit too because they're all together.

#### 10. Jinhae-roo
Nice jogging place overlooking the ocean

#### 11. Jangbok mountain (Shiri bong)
Beautiful mountain. There are 2 famous peaks: Shiri-bong and Cheonja-bong. I think Shiri-bong bong is more approachable but it still takes about 5 hours in total. Very fun though!

#### 12. Anmin Gogae
It's a very curvy road to go to Changwon, nearby city. I like it because it's a good place to hike and lots of cherry blossom trees. Can see the whole city from the top.

### Andong
